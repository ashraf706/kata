## Diamond Kata

This repository implements the `Diamond Kata` problem found in this link:
https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos/tree/master/Diamond%20Kata 

### How to test

The `DiamondTest` class contains all the tests. 
Please clone the repository, navigate to the folder from the terminal and run `mvn test` to execute all the tests.

**The application can be run from the `App` class as well**

### Notes

* I have taken TDD approach to solve the problem
* Hence, I haven't squashed the commits (so that we can discuss further if necessary)
* The tests in second last commit `674ef48` contain `-` to make development phase easier
* The implementation has a class `Diamond` and the relevant test class `DiamondTest`
* I haven't checked or Googled any solution. As a result my approach may be a bit rusty
